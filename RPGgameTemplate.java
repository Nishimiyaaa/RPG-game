      //(Xp Section and Increasing the Monster's Stats on it's death) 
      //2.1 If the Player has killed the Monster, The Player gains xp (Pxp = Pxp + Mxp)
      // The Monster Gains a Level (MLevel++;) <-- MLevel++ is adding 1 to the original amount of MLevel (Defeated++;) 
      //2.2 After the monster dies, The next monster has increased stats from the previous Monster (MAttack = MAttack + 1; MDefense = MDefense + 1;) 
      //2.3 After, the player has gained the xp, The amount of xp that the Monster drops increases by 1.5x (Mxp = Mxp*1.5)
      //2.4 Make a If statement on if (Mlevel > Defeated) then all the programs that corresponds to the Monster dying and remaking another with improved stats will work (Will Have to Change Later)
      //3. Monster's Attack (Player's Health - Monster's Attack)
      //4. Find if the player is alive to move on (Player's Health > 0) <-- Finds if the Player's Health is above 1
      //5.
